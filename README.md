# Simple Task Manager (Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This is a basic, single-page web application for managing tasks, built using only HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. It demonstrates fundamental frontend development concepts, including:

* Displaying a list of items
* Adding new items
* Updating item status (mark as completed)
* Deleting items
* Filtering items based on their status

This project was developed based on a frontend developer task instruction.

## Features

* View Tasks: See a list of all your tasks.
* Add New Task: Easily add new tasks to your list.
* Mark as Completed: Toggle the completion status of a task with a checkbox. Completed tasks are visually styled differently (strikethrough and light green background).
* Delete Task: Remove tasks from the list.
* Filter Tasks: Filter the task list to show:
    * All tasks
    * Active (uncompleted) tasks
    * Completed tasks

## Technologies Used

* HTML5: For the structure and content of the web page.
* CSS3: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.
* JavaScript (ES6+): For all the interactive logic, including task management and filtering.
